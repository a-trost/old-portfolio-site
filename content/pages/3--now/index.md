I'm:

* Living in New Haven, Connecticut.
* Getting married in July to my incredible partner Ellen.
* Working away on my last project for my Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree.
* Working to improve my programming skill set every day.
* Actively searching for a front-end developer position near New Haven, CT.
* Waking up every day to complete my morning routine.
* Working harder at staying in contact with friends and family. 

I don't do Social Media as much as most, so this is a good public declaration of my priorities and activities. The Now List idea by the fantastic [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now).
