I'm:
* Living in New Haven, Connecticut.
* Finishing my last year of teaching.
* Getting married in July to my incredible partner Ellen.
* Working away on my last project for my Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree.
* Preparing for a job hunt to find a Frontend Developer position.
* Maintaining the Django web app I created for my school to help students and teachers.
* Waking up every day to complete my morning routine.
* Working harder at staying in contact with friends and family. 


I don't do Social Media like most other people, so this is a good public declaration of my priorities and activities. The Now List idea by the fantastic [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now).
