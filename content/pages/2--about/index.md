![Alex Trost Portrait](./Alex-Portrait.jpg)
Hey, I'm Alex Trost, a Frontend Developer from Philadelphia, now living in New Haven. I like solving problems and eliminating repetitive tasks with code. I learned Python and JavaScript to help teachers focus on the kids and let computers stress about the rest.


I worked in a data-intense school and realized I wasn't nearly as good at parsing the hundreds of data points as a computer would be. So my first summer vacation, I taught myself Python so I could make a Django webapp. My little school of 300 kids and teachers use it to make learning just a *bit* easier.

I tossed a lot of problems at my web app and wanted to take my learning further, so I got a *Google Developer Challenge Scholarship* to help me learn front end languages and frameworks like JavaScript and React. From there I'm taking the full Udacity Front End Nanodegree while teaching.
