Yeah, I know you've heard of Khan Academy. I know you know it's free and that it's backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They've partnered with Google, NASA and probably the pope as of this blog post. They have courses on everything from elementary school to advanced mathematics, to career advice, programming... the list goes on and on.

It's a public resource up there with Wikipedia in terms of great ways to educate the world. You don't need that rehashed from me.

I want to talk specifically about the brilliance in the way they handle their interactive tests.

All learning apps give immediate feedback, telling the student if they're correct. But look at the user interface above. The answer is wrong, but you don't see any red text, no big red X, no "Incorrect". Most important is the idea that I get a chance to fix it. The circular arrow, the language - all of it is encouraging perseverance with the problem. I learn from my mistake, I get a second chance and help if needed.

This is exactly the process that I try to walk students through in my small groups. Telling a student know they're wrong isn't nearly as useful as telling them *why* they're wrong. Giving hints and support is usually what a student needs to reach that next step in their learning.

Additionally, by not moving on to the next problem, the program lets the student know that perseverance is more important than getting it right the first time.
